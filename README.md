# My Fitness Tracker

A full stack application that allows users to create new workouts, add exercises to these workouts and then keep session records for each exercie each time they complete a workout. Users can keep track of their progress and see their improvement over time.

A dynamic color scheme has been used to show progress since the last session:

- Red = worsened performance
- Yellow = same performance
- Green = improved performance

The metrics are ordered in level of importance (in terms of for performance) from left to right.
I.e. an improvement in lifting weight will result in the entire session row turning green.
